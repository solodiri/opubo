          <h2>The Hostory of King Jaja Of Opobo</h2>
          <img className="headerImage" src={jaja} alt="warCanoe" />
          <p>
            King Jaja of Opobo (full name: Jubo Jubogha; 1821–1891) was the
            first king (amanyanabo) of Opobo. He was also the founder of Opobo
            Kingdom in present-day Rivers State and Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his youth, Jaja was kidnapped from Igboland by black slave
            raiders and sold into slavery. He was then brought to Ijawland
            thereafter. As was customary amongst the Ijaw, Jaja earned his way
            out of slavery after serving his master for a number of years. At
            the death of his master, he took charge of the trade and went on to
            head the Anna Pepple House merchant faction of Bonny. Under him,
            Annie Pepple absorbed other trade houses until a war with the
            Manilla Pepple House led by Oko Jumbo compelled Jaja to break away
            to establish Opobo Kingdom (26 miles east of Bonny) in 1869.
          </p>
          <p>
            Opobo came to be a prominent trading post in the region's palm oil
            trade. Jaja barred entry to European and African middlemen,
            effectively monopolizing trade, and by 1870 was selling eight
            thousand tons of palm oil directly to the British. Opobo also
            shipped palm oil directly to Liverpool. Despite his trade rivalry
            with the Europeans, Jaja sent his children to schools in Glasgow and
            enlisted whites to staff the secular school he built in Opobo. He
            barred any missionaries from entering Opobo.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the 1884 Berlin Conference the Europeans designated Opobo as
            British territory. When Jaja refused to cease taxing the British
            traders, Henry Hamilton Johnston, a British vice consul, invited
            Jaja for negotiations in 1887. Jaja was arrested on arrival aboard a
            British vessel; he was tried in Accra in the Gold Coast (now Ghana)
            then exiled, first to London, and later to Saint Vincent and
            Barbados in the British West Indies. His presence in the West Indies
            was alleged to be the cause of civil unrest, as the people of
            Barbados, of African descent, were upset at the poor treatment of a
            King from their homeland.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1891, Jaja was granted permission to return to Opobo, but died en
            route. Following his exile and death, the power of the Opobo state
            rapidly declined. In 1903 the King Jaja of Opobo Memorial was
            erected in his honor in Opobo town centre.
          </p>
          <p>
            The grave of Nigerian Prince Waribo, son of King Jaja of Opobo is in
            the churchyard at St Laurence Parish Church, Frodsham, Cheshire.
            Prince Waribo was sent to Frodsham to be educated at Manor House
            School. He sadly died from inflammation of the lungs on 21st April
            1882. There are 2 white arrows indicating the way to the Prince's
            grave. One at the entrance opposite the Ring O,'Bells and the other
            further down the pathway showing the direction to his grave. It has
            no headstone but there is an inscription on the edging stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ancient City State of Opobo stands as a founder’s delight. Chief
            Jack Annie Pepple and other pioneer Chiefs eluded their home in
            Grand Bonny the heartland of the Ibani people, to establish a new
            kingdom called “Opobo” (English for Opubo-ama, or the Kingdom of
            Opobo). It was derived from the name of legendary King Opubo (1738 –
            1830) a celebrated Ibani monarch. Thanks to the strategic vision of
            Chief Jack Annie Pepple, the establishment of Opobo became an
            economic and political master stroke.
          </p>
          <p>
            It went far beyond its immediate cause, which was the 1869 war in
            Grand Bonny between Fubara Manilla group of Houses led by Chief Oko
            Jumbo and the Opubo Annie Pepple group led by Chief Jack Annie
            Pepple whose Ibani name of JuwoJuwo was rendered as Jaja by the
            British. The legend of Jaja was in the making, on the horn of danger
            and destruction that would have terrified lesser men. Not Jaja. For
            he turned the crisis of a civil war and defeat in Bonny into a great
            advantage for him and pioneer chiefs of Opobo, with the
            establishment of a new kingdom. Jaja and his group secured a
            geographical location that reinforced their tactical and diplomatic
            vision as founding fathers. The land stood just about a day’s paddle
            away from their ancestral Ibani root. With it they were set to turn
            their new kingdom into a unique 19th century bridge for commerce.
            They crowned their leader Chief Jack Annie Pepple (Juwo Juwo) as
            King Jaja, the first Amanyanabo of Opobo Kingdom. They chose
            December 25, 1870 to establish Opobo. From its location, Opobo
            easily reached out to set up trading posts with land-based farmer
            communities. There spread out under thick foliages of fresh water
            forests to the left of the kingdom, along the one – way direction of
            a resolute Imo River. The run of the river covered hinterland
            sections of the Ogoni, Ndoki, Ibibio, Annang, Etche, Ngwa and Igbo
            people. And to its right, the new kingdom followed the tidal sweep
            of the Atlantic Ocean. Opobo traders went through winding rivers and
            creeks to build business interests linking different communities
            with deft socio-cultural ties that were largely viable. These took
            them into maritime coastal communities of Andoni, Ibibio, and Ibuno
            among others on the south eastern tip of the old Oil Rivers
            protectorate. This was before colonial Britain seized the Niger
            Delta. The region was later shaped into part of a new political
            entity called Nigeria, which Britain created. King Jaja and the
            founding Chiefs demonstrated tenacity of purpose, statesmanship and
            commercial drive to bring Opobo to international prominence. The
            Kingdom quickly became one of the six leading City States of the Oil
            Rivers protectorate. Their strategic moves successfully engineered
            their local economy into prime relevance in the Palm Produce trade
            of 19th Century. Europe designed the trade to favour infant
            industries belonging to its urban merchant class, at the expense of
            rural West African communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Against this economic confrontation, King Jaja earned distinction as
            a leading entrepreneur and nationalist in the struggle against
            Europe’s business driven political agenda. Together with the pioneer
            Chiefs of Opobo Kingdom, King Jaja built a flourishing City – State
            that helped to shape trade, education and diplomatic relations
            between European countries and paramount Niger Delta Kingdoms. These
            endeavours helped to define and strengthen the economy of the Niger
            Delta. Unfortunately the same endeavours sign-posted King Jaja as a
            symbol of potential indigenous control of the unfolding trade with
            Europe, an unyielding nationalist and first apostle of “resource
            control” in the Niger Delta. His position threatened the agenda of
            imperial Britain. He was subsequently abducted by Britain through
            ungentlemanly guile, tried under false charges and dispatched into
            exile like kings of other prominent communities, to clear the coast
            for the British. With Jaja and his fellow symbols of indigenous
            control of the Niger Delta out of the way, the British made rapid
            progress in imposing their empire on the region. They became the
            colonial master! To seek a new direction for the home of King Jaja,
            this narrative was revisited with holistic passion by His Majesty
            King Dandeson Douglas Jaja (Jeki V or King Jaja the Fifth) in his
            coronation address as Amanyanabo of Opobo Kingdom on January 3,
            2004.
          </p>
          <p>
            The communities of the kingdom sprawl out on a geographical canvass
            whose coordinates are latitude O4o34’N and longitude O7o12’E. The
            kingdom’s location on the interphase between Imo Rivers estuary and
            the Atlantic Ocean, has surrounded Opobo with more brackish than
            saline water. This derives from the volume of run off freshwater
            into Imo Rivers estuary from the hinterland and the large rainfall
            of over 3000mm per annum. The result is a more delicate ecosystem.
            It is mixed with the flora and fauna of both fresh water tolerant
            species such as the Nypa palm vegetation as well as a saline
            sensitive stock of shell fishes. There are also the flourish of rare
            mangrove forests of white and red varieties. Modern Opobo Kingdom is
            renewing the vision of relevance of its economy. King Dandeson
            Douglas Jaja JP, Jeki V Amanyanabo of Opobo, began succession rites
            in 1980, when his illustrious father King Douglas Jaja (Jaja IV),
            joined his ancestors. The coronation ceremony on January 3, 2004 has
            ushered in a systematic process of structures to enhance
            consultations and participation by the citizenry. They are to
            harness and redirect the human, cultural and social resources of the
            kingdom to fit into a productive local economy in a dynamic world.
            Appropriate committees have been set up by 2005 on the first
            anniversary of the coronation. A plan of action with innovations to
            inspire the kingdom, is being concretized under the leadership of
            the Council of Alapu (Chiefs) and the Amanyanabo of Opobo Kingdom.
            Opobo Town is the headquarters of Opobo/Nkoro Local Government Area
            created in 1996.The Kingdom is made up of satellite towns namely:
            Kalaibiama, Queens Town, Minima, Illoma and Epellema, Ekereborikiri,
            Down-Below, Abazibie and Opukalama. There are also settlements and
            villages or fishing ports belonging to various Wari (War Canoe
            Houses) and Polo (Group of Houses or Section) of Opobo Kingdom.
            STRUCTURE AND SYMBOLS Opobo Kingdom has 67 Wari (War Canoe Houses or
            Chieftaincy Compounds) each of which is headed by an Alabo
            (Chief).The 67 Wari belong to the 14 Polo whose pioneer chiefs
            established Opobo Kingdom as the founding fathers. It was their
            success and those of their descendants as competitive entrepreneurs
            in the Palm Produce economy that led to the flourish of the number
            of Wari in each Polo. At the head of the kingdom is the Amanyanabo
            who is the Paramount Ruler and the King. The 14 Polo inaugurated by
            the founding Chiefs and their 67 Wari are as follows in order of
            size: King Jaja Polo (14 War Canoe Houses or Wari), Datoo Polo (8),
            Dappaye Amakiri Polo (7), Diepiri Polo (6), Kalaomuso Polo (5),
            Ukonu Polo (5), Kieprima Polo (4), Iruanya Polo (4) Epelle Polo (
            3), Tolofari Polo ( 3), Fubarakuro Polo (2), Owujie Polo (2), Biriye
            Polo(2), Adibie Polo (2). MEMBERS OF COUNCIL OF ALAPU: At present
            there are 26 Members of the Council of Alapu in Opobo Kingdom. The
            number changes as War Canoe Houses in each Polo come forward to fill
            their vacant chieftaincy stools. The Council sits regularly with the
            Amanyanabo as chairman, to deliberate on issues affecting the
            kingdom. The council is backed by two types of committees, created
            by the Amanyanabo since the inauguration of January 3, 2004. The
            first includes a number of strategic committees to deal with
            innovative ideas or issues that have tactical or strategic
            implications. The Awards Programme Committee (with Alabo Prof DMJ
            Fubara as its chairman) and The Blueprint Committee (under Prof
            Winston BellGam) are good examples. The second group of committees
            are administrative, to facilitate decision making or detailed
            implementation. Good examples include The Cultural Matters committee
            under Alabo I.C. Ogolo Fubara, the Tourism And Culture committee to
            be reconstituted and The Publicity Committee led by Alabo G.O.N.
            Bupo. Both sets of committees report to the full council, thus
            contributing to the effective management of the kingdom by the
            Amanyanabo and the Council of Alapu.

          <p>
            TRADITIONAL FLAGS Each War Canoe house has its own “badge”, a
            traditional flag on which is written in bold relief the name and
            symbol of the original founder of each Chieftaincy or War Canoe
            House. The flags are as many as the number of Houses that have come
            to comprise the Kingdom. These stood at 67 by the end of the 1940s
            when the last chieftaincy Houses were created. These traditional
            flags are usually hoisted with due ceremonies on the 24th December
            (Christmas Eve) every year, to commemorate the founding of Opobo
            Kingdom and to herald a month-long season of festivals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flags are rolled up on the last day of January of the New Year
            to close the festive season. Apart from traditional flags, there are
            other historical artifacts with which every war canoe house is
            identified. These include wooden gongs (“Ekere”), Wooden
            Xylophone-(“Ngelenge”), Boat Shed (“Aruwari”), family shrine
            (“Duobie”), and community shrines (“Luko”). WAR CANOES The Omu Aru
            (War Canoe) is the gun boat. It was perhaps the defining symbol,
            representing political authority and power of the War Canoe House.
            It was also a statement of the collective capacity for self defense
            in men and material by the kingdom. Even more, it was the instrument
            for maintaining territorial integrity and business interests: either
            securing access or protecting markets of the kingdom, as in
            settlements/trading posts belonging to the Wari or Polo. Usually
            equipped with four canons, the War Canoe displayed massive firepower
            and long range capability: with one canon each to the fore, rear and
            to both sides at the middle of a long dug-out canoe, it had capacity
            for an average of 50 persons. Drummers in each party sat on a
            pre-fabricated loose wooden platform at the centre, in the bowel of
            the boat. This gave them some security. Theirs was the arduous task
            to whip the blood of the warriors into battle frenzy. Their wooden
            gongs or Ekere arranged in a definite tonal order, provided the
            hard-ware to pump a steady dose of music-like adrenalin into the
            blood stream of the warriors. The rest of the men had a dual role.
            They sat two in a row on the wooden crossings (nduru) in the boat.
            Their paddles flowed in unison, to power the War Canoe as fast as
            necessary to destination. They also served as warriors, armed with
            weapons of war to engage the enemy on contact or as their commander
            directed. GIGI (REGATTA BOAT) It is a long canoe fully decorated
            with flags and buntings as well as drummers, to serve on relevant
            ceremonial occasions. One of such occasions is when the Alabo
            (Chief) of each Wari is required to display during his chieftaincy
            installation or join other Wari in a collective display during
            appropriate festive occasions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The drummers embedded in the “gigi” work their instruments of
            xylophone (Ngelenge), bass drum (Akusa) and assorted wooden gongs
            (Ekere) to provide a rhythm which 32 or more paddlers follow. The
            annual Nwotam regatta display on December 31, has given the event an
            added dimension. Colorful troupes (called Uke) in various categories
            (senior, intermediate and minor) are produced by the 5 main groups
            currently in the centre of Nwotam activities of the kingdom. Unlike
            the Gigi display by Wari or Polo on chieftaincy related occasions,
            the Nwotam regatta is an annual event. It is not tied to any House
            or Polo. In fact their membership is drawn from across different
            Polo and different professional specializations. Sometimes it is
            drawn from communities even outside Opobo Kingdom. The Nwotam groups
            are each autonomous but are coordinated under a central body, with
            Uke Mkpa as the apex organization. Uke Mkpa has the custody of the
            Nwotam masquerade regalia and regulates the dance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Amanyanabo is usually the Grand Patron of Uke Mkpa. In random
            order, the Nwotam groups or Uke as each one is called, are as
            follows:
          </p>
          <p>i) Ejesilem Movement of Nigeria</p>
          <p>ii) Ugele Mkpa Society</p>
          <p>iii) Ofo-Na-Ogu Society</p>
          <p>iv) Amatemeso Movement</p>
          <p>v) Iyi-Eke Society</p>
          <p>
            The gigi of each Uke parades the Opobo river to entertain thousands
            of spectators that gather at the waterfronts every December 31. It
            is a colourful outburst of decorations, drummers and dancers that
            ignite the kingdom with pulsating rhythm. They continue to dance,
            from the landing of the regatta boats in the evening of December 31,
            until the Nwotam cultural explosion on January 1st. This has become
            a regular slot on the Opobo cultural calendar. Such displays have
            enhanced the backbone of the regatta culture in Opobo and added to
            the kingdom’s enthusiasm to utilize its unqualified advantage in
            this water sport.
