          <h3>THE MANILA TREE</h3>

          <img className="" src={manila} alt="projectImg" />
          <h4>A Relic of Ancient Glory. An Ensign of the Rich and Free!</h4>

          <p>
            The manila tree became the symbol of Opobo as a City State in 1870
            and had remained so until today. These cast iron tree-like objects,
            which came in various sizes and heights, were used to display the
            ‘manila-money’.
          </p>
          <p>
            The manila was the currency historically used for buying and
            selling. They too came in varied sizes with the heavier weights and
            larger sizes valued higher than their lighter, smaller counterparts.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with any world economy, the more ‘trees’ you have, the more
            wealth you can display, and consequently the more respect you
            garner.
          </p>
          <p>
            People around the coast and beyond came to know Opobo traders and
            merchants as wealthy people as they were able to display their
            wealth on their ‘trees’ for all to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            This visible sign of wealth displayed all over town made Opobo
            Kingdom an economic force to reckon with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oral history has it that men loved using their manila to buy
            wrappers and jewelry for their wives. The women used these expensive
            wrappers for economic bartering when needed. This gave rise to the
            popular saying in Opobo that ‘a woman’s wealth is in her box!’ To
            date, an Opobo woman places a lot of value on the contents in her
            trunk box.
