            Rivers State Governor Siminalayi Fubara has slammed those who claim
            Opobo is not Ijaw.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fubara who spoke when he met with the Regent of Kalabari, Charles
            Princewill, and other representatives of the Kalabari Kingdom, on
            Friday at the Government House, Port Harcourt, stated that “Ijaw is
            not complete without Opobo”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The former governor of Rivers State, now Minister of the Federal
            Capital Territory, (FCT), Nyesom Wike had at a book lunch in Port
            Harcourt, insinuated that some persons had said Opobo people were
            not Ijaw.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wike’s comment came amidst the rising tension in the political space
            in the state that has seen the State House of Assembly split into
            two factions, and the attempted impeachment of the governor, an
            action many have accused the FCT Minister of orchestrating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking to the Regent of Kalabari, and other representatives of the
            Kalabari kingdom, Fubara who is of the Opobo extraction of Ijaw,
            dismissed insinuations in some quarters that labelled him as a
            non-Ijaw.
          </p>
          <p>
            The governor said such persons are ignorant of the history of the
            Ijaw struggle in the Niger Delta.
          </p>
          <p>
            He emphasized that the people of Opobo were involved in the Ijaw
            struggle, which makes him a true Ijaw son.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fubara said, “There is this speculation everywhere; Fubara is not a
            core Ijaw, Fubara is a half-baked Ijaw.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ijaw is not complete without Opobo. So whoever is feeding you with
            that information, should go back to their history classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You can’t talk about the Ijaw struggle without the Opobo, the Bonny
            and the Kalabaris. We had our own trade line at that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And for you to occupy a trade line, it means you are a true Ijaw
            man.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, for the record, I’m a full-blooded, up to my bone, an Ijaw.”
          </p>
